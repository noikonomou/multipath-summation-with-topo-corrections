# GPR data multipath-summation-with-topo-corrections


Instructions on how to use the m files are in the main script within the directory "Code".
For the implementation of multi-path summation we use the package "hyperbola recognition", which can be downloaded from https://github.com/lweileeds/hyperbola_recognition.

This package is used to automatically detect hyperbolas within the GPR section. The hyperbolas are used for GPR velocities estimation which in their turn are invlolved in a multipath summation scheme, which finilizes to topographic corrections.
